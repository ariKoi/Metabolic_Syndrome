    "text": "The study is a comparative analysis of two different models of metabolic syndrome, high fat and high fat+high fructose, in rats using a metabolomic approach.\nThe main questions it attempts to answer are: Which of the two models is more suitable for drawing conclusions about the human pathology of metabolic syndrome? Is there a differentiation of the metabolomic profile between the two dietary models? Is either of the profiles closer to the average metabolic profile of an individual with metabolic syndrome? Does either of the two models reveal early biomarkers? If so, do any of them match known human markers? The experimental models were designed for a duration of 8 weeks, but the study was extended by an additional month.\nThis time extension led to an initial divergence of the metabolomic profiles, but gradual convergence thereafter. The question that arises is whether the final metabolic profile of metabolic syndrome is unique, but the pathways leading to it differ. What is the degree of success of each model in terms of the 5 key features of metabolic syndrome. Regarding the experimental design. The study included two different dietary models to induce metabolic syndrome in rats. The samples were analyzed at various time points (5) metabolomic analysis and biochemical markers. The data collected include hematological, biochemical and metabolomic measurements in blood.\n\n\nData collection occurred in monthly intervals:\nTime point 0: Baseline or pre-treatment\nTime point 1: 1 month after nutrition plan treatment\nTime point 2: 2 months after nutrition plan treatment\nTime point 3: 3 months after nutrition plan treatment\nTime point 4: 3 months after nutrition plan treatment (same as time point 3) but post-mortem measurements using a different blood sample extraction method than in the other time points.\nThe post-mortem clinical data i.e. weight, LDL, triglycerides etc. correspond to time point 4, and therefore match the metabolite data at time point 4. The match will be used to derive surrogate or substitute response variables (from the list of metabolites) for each variable of interest in the clinical data, since for the clinical data there is only 1 measurement in time. This is further described in the modeling page.\nTime point 4 will be excluded from the longitudinal analysis since it was post-mortem.\nAt time point 0 there were differences in the age of rats, and those differences are currently not known. At time point 1, these age differences were corrected by sampling the rat measurements asynchronously. Hence and since time will be a covariate in all models, age is not considered as a covariate i.e. proportional to time since all rats have same age from time point 1. In addition, in order to correct for age differences at time point 0, the models will adjust for metabolites at time point 0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Missing values per variable, sorted by the percetange to the total 169 observations.

with several metabolites that reflect alterations in glucose, lipid, amino acid, and energy metabolism. Key metabolites include:\n\nLipid Metabolites\n\nTriglycerides (TG): Elevated in metabolic syndrome, indicating impaired fat metabolism. Free fatty acids (FFA): Increased levels contribute to insulin resistance and inflammation. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and Very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL): Higher levels of these “bad” cholesterol types are common. High-density lipoprotein (HDL): Reduced “good” cholesterol levels are a marker of metabolic syndrome. Ceramides: Bioactive lipids linked to insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease.\n\nGlucose and Energy Metabolites\n\nGlucose: Elevated fasting glucose is a diagnostic marker of metabolic syndrome. Insulin: High levels indicate insulin resistance. Lactate: Increased due to altered glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction. Ketone bodies (β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate): Altered levels indicate disrupted fatty acid oxidation.\n\nAmino Acid Metabolites\n\nBranched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) (Leucine, Isoleucine, Valine): Elevated levels are strongly linked to insulin resistance. Aromatic amino acids (Tyrosine, Phenylalanine): Increased levels are associated with obesity and diabetes risk. Glutamate and Glutamine: Higher glutamate and lower glutamine levels are associated with metabolic dysfunction.\n\nInflammatory and Oxidative Stress Metabolites\n\nC-reactive protein (CRP): A marker of systemic inflammation. Homocysteine: Elevated levels are linked to cardiovascular risk. Oxidized LDL: A marker of oxidative stress and atherosclerosis risk.\n\nGut Microbiome-Derived Metabolites\n\nShort-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) (Butyrate, Acetate, Propionate): Reduced levels may indicate an unhealthy gut microbiome. Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO): Elevated levels are associated with cardiovascular disease risk. These metabolites collectively indicate metabolic dysfunction, insulin resistance, and increased cardiovascular risk. Monitoring and targeting these biomarkers through diet, exercise, and medications can help manage metabolic syndrome.\n✅ Strongly Associated Biomarkers for Metabolic Syndrome:\n\nTrimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) – Elevated levels are linked to cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, and gut microbiota imbalance.\nCholine – Essential for lipid metabolism; imbalances are linked to NAFLD and insulin resistance.\nSerine – Low levels are associated with insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction.\nGlycine – Reduced in MetS; involved in antioxidant defense and glucose metabolism.\nAlanine – Increased in MetS; involved in gluconeogenesis and insulin resistance.\nIsoleucine – Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and metabolic dysfunction.\nLeucine – Elevated levels correlate with MetS, obesity, and T2D.\nCreatinine – A marker of muscle metabolism and kidney function, associated with insulin resistance and MetS progression.\nTaurine – Linked to lipid metabolism, blood pressure regulation, and oxidative stress.\nBetaine – Plays a role in homocysteine metabolism; imbalances can contribute to cardiovascular risk.\nTyrosine – Elevated in insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction.\nPhenylalanine – Increased in MetS, linked to impaired glucose metabolism.\nAcetylcarnitine – Implicated in fatty acid metabolism dysfunction in MetS.\nFructose – High intake contributes to insulin resistance and fatty liver disease.\nGlucose – A core biomarker of insulin resistance and diabetes.\nMannose – Altered metabolism is linked to insulin resistance.\nLactic Acid – Increased in mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic disorders.\nPyruvic Acid (Pyruvate) – Involved in glycolysis; alterations signal metabolic dysfunction.\n\n🟡 Moderately Associated Biomarkers (Need Further Validation):\n\nPutrescine & Cadaverine – Polyamines linked to gut microbiota and inflammation in MetS.\nSarcosine – Related to methylation and lipid metabolism, but its role in MetS is unclear.\nHistamine – Involved in inflammatory responses and metabolic homeostasis.\nHypotaurine – Precursor to taurine; may help counter oxidative stress in MetS.\nAsparagine – Altered levels may reflect amino acid metabolism changes in MetS.\nAspartic Acid – May be involved in energy metabolism and oxidative stress.\nMethionine – Essential for methylation reactions; altered levels may affect lipid metabolism.\nLysine – Essential amino acid; its metabolic disturbances could relate to insulin resistance.\nAnthranilic Acid – A metabolite of tryptophan linked to inflammation and gut microbiota.\nIndole-3-Lactic Acid – Gut-derived metabolite with possible metabolic and inflammatory implications.\n5-Hydroxy-L-Tryptophan (5OH-L-Tryptophan) – A serotonin precursor involved in neuroendocrine and metabolic regulation.\nXanthurenic Acid – A tryptophan metabolite associated with insulin resistance and oxidative stress.\nBenzoic Acid – Related to gut microbiota metabolism, possibly linked to MetS.\nXanthine & Hypoxanthine – Purine metabolism intermediates; increased levels may be linked to oxidative stress and insulin resistance.\n\n❌ Less Relevant or Weak Evidence for MetS:\nThese metabolites are less directly linked to metabolic syndrome but may still have indirect roles:\n\nMethylamine, Dimethylamine, Trimethylamine – Related to gut metabolism but not primary MetS markers. Monoisoamylamine – Limited data on its role in MetS.\nCytosine, Uracil, Thymine, Adenine, Guanine, Cytidine, Thymidine, Adenosine, Inosine, Uridine, Maltose, Ribose, Xylitol, Arabitol – These are nucleotides and sugars with limited direct associations to MetS.\nCaffeine – May have protective effects against MetS but is not a biomarker.\nCotinine – A nicotine metabolite, not directly related to MetS.\nMannitol, Lactose, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) – Not considered primary biomarkers for MetS.\n\n📌 Summary:\nStrongest biomarkers: TMAO, Choline, Serine, Glycine, Alanine, BCAAs (Isoleucine, Leucine), Taurine, Betaine, Acetylcarnitine, Glucose, Lactic Acid, Fructose.\nModerate biomarkers: Polyamines (Putrescine, Cadaverine), Tryptophan metabolites, Histamine, Hypotaurine.\nLess relevant metabolites: Nucleotides, sugar alcohols, caffeine.\n\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of TMAO\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Choline, Betaine, Carnitine (Acetylcarnitine), Trimethylamine, Dimethylamine, Methylamine\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Serine, Methionine, Glycine, Taurine, Creatinine, Histamine, Hypotaurine\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Fructose, Glucose, Lactic Acid, Pyruvic Acid, Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Cadaverine\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of Choline\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Betaine, Serine, Methionine, Glycine, Acetylcarnitine\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Trimethylamine, Dimethylamine, Methylamine, Taurine, Histamine, Creatinine\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Fructose, Glucose, Lactic Acid, Pyruvic Acid, Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Cadaverine\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of Serine\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Glycine, Methionine, Asparagine, Aspartic Acid, Glutamine, Pyruvic Acid\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Choline, Betaine, Taurine, Histamine, Lactic Acid\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Fructose, Glucose, Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Cadaverine, Creatinine\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of Glycine\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Serine, Methionine, Choline, Betaine, Glutamine, Aspartic Acid\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Taurine, Histamine, Acetylcarnitine, Creatinine, Lactic Acid\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Fructose, Glucose, Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Cadaverine, Phenylalanine\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of Alanine\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Pyruvic Acid, Aspartic Acid, Glutamine, Glutamate, Lactic Acid, Asparagine\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Serine, Glycine, Methionine, Creatinine, Glucose, Fructose\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Cadaverine, Phenylalanine, Taurine\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of Isoleucine\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Leucine, Valine, Aspartic Acid, Glutamine, Pyruvic Acid\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Alanine, Serine, Methionine, Creatinine, Lactic Acid, Glucose\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Histamine, Taurine, Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Fructose\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of Leucine\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Isoleucine, Valine, Aspartic Acid, Glutamine, Pyruvic Acid\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Alanine, Serine, Methionine, Creatinine, Lactic Acid, Glucose\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Histamine, Taurine, Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Fructose\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of Creatinine\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Creatine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Alanine, Glutamine, Glutamate\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Valine, Methionine, Aspartic Acid, Pyruvic Acid, Lactic Acid, Glucose, Fructose\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Histamine, Taurine, Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Mannose, Ribose\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of Taurine\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Methionine, Hypotaurine, Glutamine, Glutamate, Aspartic Acid\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Serine, Alanine, Creatinine, Glucose, Fructose, Lactic Acid, Pyruvic Acid\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Histamine, Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Mannose, Ribose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Correlation plot of metabolites considering all time points and nutrition models.

    "text": "Data collection occurred in monthly intervals:\nTime point 0: Baseline or pre-treatment\nTime point 1: 1 month after nutrition plan treatment\nTime point 2: 2 months after nutrition plan treatment\nTime point 3: 3 months after nutrition plan treatment\nTime point 4: 3 months after nutrition plan treatment (same as time point 3) but post-mortem measurements using a different blood sample extraction method than in the other time points.\nThe post-mortem clinical data i.e. weight, LDL, triglycerides etc. correspond to time point 4, and therefore match the metabolite data at time point 4. The match will be used to derive surrogate or substitute response variables (from the list of metabolites) for each variable of interest in the clinical data, since for the clinical data there is only 1 measurement in time. This is further described in the modeling page.\nTime point 4 will be excluded from the longitudinal analysis since it was post-mortem.\nAt time point 0 there were differences in the age of rats, and those differences are currently not known. At time point 1, these age differences were corrected by sampling the rat measurements asynchronously. Hence and since time will be a covariate in all models, age is not considered as a covariate i.e. proportional to time since all rats have same age from time point 1. In addition, in order to correct for age differences at time point 0, the models will adjust for metabolites at time point 0.",

    "text": "Metabolic syndrome is associated with several metabolites that reflect alterations in glucose, lipid, amino acid, and energy metabolism. Key metabolites include:\n\nLipid Metabolites\n\nTriglycerides (TG): Elevated in metabolic syndrome, indicating impaired fat metabolism. Free fatty acids (FFA): Increased levels contribute to insulin resistance and inflammation. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and Very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL): Higher levels of these “bad” cholesterol types are common. High-density lipoprotein (HDL): Reduced “good” cholesterol levels are a marker of metabolic syndrome. Ceramides: Bioactive lipids linked to insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease.\n\nGlucose and Energy Metabolites\n\nGlucose: Elevated fasting glucose is a diagnostic marker of metabolic syndrome. Insulin: High levels indicate insulin resistance. Lactate: Increased due to altered glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction. Ketone bodies (β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate): Altered levels indicate disrupted fatty acid oxidation.\n\nAmino Acid Metabolites\n\nBranched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) (Leucine, Isoleucine, Valine): Elevated levels are strongly linked to insulin resistance. Aromatic amino acids (Tyrosine, Phenylalanine): Increased levels are associated with obesity and diabetes risk. Glutamate and Glutamine: Higher glutamate and lower glutamine levels are associated with metabolic dysfunction.\n\nInflammatory and Oxidative Stress Metabolites\n\nC-reactive protein (CRP): A marker of systemic inflammation. Homocysteine: Elevated levels are linked to cardiovascular risk. Oxidized LDL: A marker of oxidative stress and atherosclerosis risk.\n\nGut Microbiome-Derived Metabolites\n\nShort-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) (Butyrate, Acetate, Propionate): Reduced levels may indicate an unhealthy gut microbiome. Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO): Elevated levels are associated with cardiovascular disease risk. These metabolites collectively indicate metabolic dysfunction, insulin resistance, and increased cardiovascular risk. Monitoring and targeting these biomarkers through diet, exercise, and medications can help manage metabolic syndrome.\n✅ Strongly Associated Biomarkers for Metabolic Syndrome:\n\nTrimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) – Elevated levels are linked to cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, and gut microbiota imbalance.\nCholine – Essential for lipid metabolism; imbalances are linked to NAFLD and insulin resistance.\nSerine – Low levels are associated with insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction.\nGlycine – Reduced in MetS; involved in antioxidant defense and glucose metabolism.\nAlanine – Increased in MetS; involved in gluconeogenesis and insulin resistance.\nIsoleucine – Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and metabolic dysfunction.\nLeucine – Elevated levels correlate with MetS, obesity, and T2D.\nCreatinine – A marker of muscle metabolism and kidney function, associated with insulin resistance and MetS progression.\nTaurine – Linked to lipid metabolism, blood pressure regulation, and oxidative stress.\nBetaine – Plays a role in homocysteine metabolism; imbalances can contribute to cardiovascular risk.\nTyrosine – Elevated in insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction.\nPhenylalanine – Increased in MetS, linked to impaired glucose metabolism.\nAcetylcarnitine – Implicated in fatty acid metabolism dysfunction in MetS.\nFructose – High intake contributes to insulin resistance and fatty liver disease.\nGlucose – A core biomarker of insulin resistance and diabetes.\nMannose – Altered metabolism is linked to insulin resistance.\nLactic Acid – Increased in mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic disorders.\nPyruvic Acid (Pyruvate) – Involved in glycolysis; alterations signal metabolic dysfunction.\n\n🟡 Moderately Associated Biomarkers (Need Further Validation):\n\nPutrescine & Cadaverine – Polyamines linked to gut microbiota and inflammation in MetS.\nSarcosine – Related to methylation and lipid metabolism, but its role in MetS is unclear.\nHistamine – Involved in inflammatory responses and metabolic homeostasis.\nHypotaurine – Precursor to taurine; may help counter oxidative stress in MetS.\nAsparagine – Altered levels may reflect amino acid metabolism changes in MetS.\nAspartic Acid – May be involved in energy metabolism and oxidative stress.\nMethionine – Essential for methylation reactions; altered levels may affect lipid metabolism.\nLysine – Essential amino acid; its metabolic disturbances could relate to insulin resistance.\nAnthranilic Acid – A metabolite of tryptophan linked to inflammation and gut microbiota.\nIndole-3-Lactic Acid – Gut-derived metabolite with possible metabolic and inflammatory implications.\n5-Hydroxy-L-Tryptophan (5OH-L-Tryptophan) – A serotonin precursor involved in neuroendocrine and metabolic regulation.\nXanthurenic Acid – A tryptophan metabolite associated with insulin resistance and oxidative stress.\nBenzoic Acid – Related to gut microbiota metabolism, possibly linked to MetS.\nXanthine & Hypoxanthine – Purine metabolism intermediates; increased levels may be linked to oxidative stress and insulin resistance.\n\n❌ Less Relevant or Weak Evidence for MetS:\nThese metabolites are less directly linked to metabolic syndrome but may still have indirect roles:\n\nMethylamine, Dimethylamine, Trimethylamine – Related to gut metabolism but not primary MetS markers. Monoisoamylamine – Limited data on its role in MetS.\nCytosine, Uracil, Thymine, Adenine, Guanine, Cytidine, Thymidine, Adenosine, Inosine, Uridine, Maltose, Ribose, Xylitol, Arabitol – These are nucleotides and sugars with limited direct associations to MetS.\nCaffeine – May have protective effects against MetS but is not a biomarker.\nCotinine – A nicotine metabolite, not directly related to MetS.\nMannitol, Lactose, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) – Not considered primary biomarkers for MetS.\n\n📌 Summary:\nStrongest biomarkers: TMAO, Choline, Serine, Glycine, Alanine, BCAAs (Isoleucine, Leucine), Taurine, Betaine, Acetylcarnitine, Glucose, Lactic Acid, Fructose.\nModerate biomarkers: Polyamines (Putrescine, Cadaverine), Tryptophan metabolites, Histamine, Hypotaurine.\nLess relevant metabolites: Nucleotides, sugar alcohols, caffeine.\n\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of TMAO\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Choline, Betaine, Carnitine (Acetylcarnitine), Trimethylamine, Dimethylamine, Methylamine\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Serine, Methionine, Glycine, Taurine, Creatinine, Histamine, Hypotaurine\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Fructose, Glucose, Lactic Acid, Pyruvic Acid, Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Cadaverine\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of Choline\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Betaine, Serine, Methionine, Glycine, Acetylcarnitine\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Trimethylamine, Dimethylamine, Methylamine, Taurine, Histamine, Creatinine\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Fructose, Glucose, Lactic Acid, Pyruvic Acid, Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Cadaverine\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of Serine\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Glycine, Methionine, Asparagine, Aspartic Acid, Glutamine, Pyruvic Acid\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Choline, Betaine, Taurine, Histamine, Lactic Acid\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Fructose, Glucose, Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Cadaverine, Creatinine\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of Glycine\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Serine, Methionine, Choline, Betaine, Glutamine, Aspartic Acid\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Taurine, Histamine, Acetylcarnitine, Creatinine, Lactic Acid\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Fructose, Glucose, Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Cadaverine, Phenylalanine\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of Alanine\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Pyruvic Acid, Aspartic Acid, Glutamine, Glutamate, Lactic Acid, Asparagine\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Serine, Glycine, Methionine, Creatinine, Glucose, Fructose\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Cadaverine, Phenylalanine, Taurine\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of Isoleucine\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Leucine, Valine, Aspartic Acid, Glutamine, Pyruvic Acid\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Alanine, Serine, Methionine, Creatinine, Lactic Acid, Glucose\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Histamine, Taurine, Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Fructose\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of Leucine\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Isoleucine, Valine, Aspartic Acid, Glutamine, Pyruvic Acid\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Alanine, Serine, Methionine, Creatinine, Lactic Acid, Glucose\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Histamine, Taurine, Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Fructose\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of Creatinine\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Creatine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Alanine, Glutamine, Glutamate\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Valine, Methionine, Aspartic Acid, Pyruvic Acid, Lactic Acid, Glucose, Fructose\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Histamine, Taurine, Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Mannose, Ribose\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of Taurine\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Methionine, Hypotaurine, Glutamine, Glutamate, Aspartic Acid\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Serine, Alanine, Creatinine, Glucose, Fructose, Lactic Acid, Pyruvic Acid\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Histamine, Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Mannose, Ribose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Correlation plot of metabolites considering all time points and nutrition models.

    "text": "References & Research Notes\n\nhttps://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/637773/why-does-harrell-argue-for-ignoring-y-during-data-reduction\n\nOne of the worst things you can do with data is to take a huge number of collinear features and predict to find the “right” features that predict Y.\n\nhttps://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/296164/does-it-make-sense-to-run-a-stepwise-regression-on-components-estimated-through\nhttps://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/441860/isnt-it-futile-to-try-to-fix-multicollinearity\n\nIf the goal is prediction then your proposed solution sounds agreeable, but inference is a whole other beast.\nThe fact is that the theory, for example concerning sampling distributions of coefficients, is not capable of conditioning in such model selection procedures. Frank Harrell talks a little bit about this in Regression Modelling Strategies in the section about stepwise regression.\nStatistics is not an algorithmic truth generating process. You need to be able to say “I think X is related to the outcome” in order to make inferences of the nature statistics affords us.\n\nhttps://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/515412/circular-reasoning-in-harrell-bbr-18-19\n\nyou agree and understand why we should prefer c-index and likelihood ratio chi square (LHRCS) to classification accuracy\n\nhttps://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/621395/how-can-i-automatically-perform-multiple-linear-regressions-in-r-to-identify-the\n\nMy advice is to NOT automate this. There are a variety of methods to do automated model selection (forward, backward, stepwise). Of these, the only ones that I would use are penalized methods such as LASSO. What you seem to want is all subsets regression, which is possible in R. There are a few methods (you can Google “all subsets regression in R” to find some) but these aren’t good. P values will be too low, standard errors too small, models too complex and parameter estimates biased away from 0. (See Frank Harrell’s book Regression Modeling Strategies for details, examples, proofs and so on).\nWorse: It stops you from thinking.\nChoose models that make sense. Just a few of them. Compare those. You’ve already shown us that you’ve done some of this.\nIf you are interested in uncovering interactions, then trees (or some offshoot of them) may be good. I’m not sure why you are opposed.\nIf you want to look at combinations of variables, and don’t need to include the original variables, then partial least squares might be good. From the variables you’ve listed, it looks like the first component will be “size”, but that may be fine.\nHarrell: The worst thing I can think of saying about variable selection methods is that they fail at what they pretend to do. They can’t select the right variables. And small changes in the dataset result in different variables selected. They there is their destruction of standard errors …\n\nhttps://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/201061/whats-wrong-with-data-guided-modeling-in-regression\nhttps://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/200242/minimum-number-of-observations-needed-for-penalized-regression/200368#200368\n\nPenalized estimation can be used for very small sample sizes; it’s just that the estimates will be shrunk to the mean very heavily, so the estimates will be conservative. But the intercept in the model is not shrunk\n\nhttps://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/491861/penalized-or-standard-logistic-regression"
