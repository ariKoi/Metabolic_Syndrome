    "text": "The study is a comparative analysis of two different models of metabolic syndrome, high fat and high fat+high fructose, in rats using a metabolomic approach.\nThe main questions it attempts to answer are: Which of the two models is more suitable for drawing conclusions about the human pathology of metabolic syndrome? Is there a differentiation of the metabolomic profile between the two dietary models? Is either of the profiles closer to the average metabolic profile of an individual with metabolic syndrome? Does either of the two models reveal early biomarkers? If so, do any of them match known human markers? The experimental models were designed for a duration of 8 weeks, but the study was extended by an additional month.\nThis time extension led to an initial divergence of the metabolomic profiles, but gradual convergence thereafter. The question that arises is whether the final metabolic profile of metabolic syndrome is unique, but the pathways leading to it differ. What is the degree of success of each model in terms of the 5 key features of metabolic syndrome. Regarding the experimental design. The study included two different dietary models to induce metabolic syndrome in rats. The samples were analyzed at various time points (5) metabolomic analysis and biochemical markers. The data collected include hematological, biochemical and metabolomic measurements in blood.\n\n\nData collection occurred in monthly intervals:\nTime point 0: Baseline or pre-treatment\nTime point 1: 1 month after nutrition plan treatment\nTime point 2: 2 months after nutrition plan treatment\nTime point 3: 3 months after nutrition plan treatment\nTime point 4: 3 months after nutrition plan treatment (same as time point 3) but post-mortem measurements using a different blood sample extraction method than in the other time points.\nThe post-mortem clinical data i.e. weight, LDL, triglycerides etc. correspond to time point 4, and therefore match the metabolite data at time point 4. The match will be used to derive surrogate or substitute response variables (from the list of metabolites) for each variable of interest in the clinical data, since for the clinical data there is only 1 measurement in time. This is further described in the modeling page.\nTime point 4 will be excluded from the longitudinal analysis since it was post-mortem.\nAt time point 0 there were differences in the age of rats, and those differences are currently not known. At time point 1, these age differences were corrected by sampling the rat measurements asynchronously. Hence and since time will be a covariate in all models, age is not considered as a covariate i.e. proportional to time since all rats have same age from time point 1. In addition, in order to correct for age differences at time point 0, the models will adjust for metabolites at time point 0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Missing values per variable, sorted by the percetange to the total 169 observations.

with several metabolites that reflect alterations in glucose, lipid, amino acid, and energy metabolism. Key metabolites include:\n\nLipid Metabolites\n\nTriglycerides (TG): Elevated in metabolic syndrome, indicating impaired fat metabolism. Free fatty acids (FFA): Increased levels contribute to insulin resistance and inflammation. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and Very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL): Higher levels of these “bad” cholesterol types are common. High-density lipoprotein (HDL): Reduced “good” cholesterol levels are a marker of metabolic syndrome. Ceramides: Bioactive lipids linked to insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease.\n\nGlucose and Energy Metabolites\n\nGlucose: Elevated fasting glucose is a diagnostic marker of metabolic syndrome. Insulin: High levels indicate insulin resistance. Lactate: Increased due to altered glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction. Ketone bodies (β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate): Altered levels indicate disrupted fatty acid oxidation.\n\nAmino Acid Metabolites\n\nBranched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) (Leucine, Isoleucine, Valine): Elevated levels are strongly linked to insulin resistance. Aromatic amino acids (Tyrosine, Phenylalanine): Increased levels are associated with obesity and diabetes risk. Glutamate and Glutamine: Higher glutamate and lower glutamine levels are associated with metabolic dysfunction.\n\nInflammatory and Oxidative Stress Metabolites\n\nC-reactive protein (CRP): A marker of systemic inflammation. Homocysteine: Elevated levels are linked to cardiovascular risk. Oxidized LDL: A marker of oxidative stress and atherosclerosis risk.\n\nGut Microbiome-Derived Metabolites\n\nShort-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) (Butyrate, Acetate, Propionate): Reduced levels may indicate an unhealthy gut microbiome. Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO): Elevated levels are associated with cardiovascular disease risk. These metabolites collectively indicate metabolic dysfunction, insulin resistance, and increased cardiovascular risk. Monitoring and targeting these biomarkers through diet, exercise, and medications can help manage metabolic syndrome.\n✅ Strongly Associated Biomarkers for Metabolic Syndrome:\n\nTrimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) – Elevated levels are linked to cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, and gut microbiota imbalance.\nCholine – Essential for lipid metabolism; imbalances are linked to NAFLD and insulin resistance.\nSerine – Low levels are associated with insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction.\nGlycine – Reduced in MetS; involved in antioxidant defense and glucose metabolism.\nAlanine – Increased in MetS; involved in gluconeogenesis and insulin resistance.\nIsoleucine – Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and metabolic dysfunction.\nLeucine – Elevated levels correlate with MetS, obesity, and T2D.\nCreatinine – A marker of muscle metabolism and kidney function, associated with insulin resistance and MetS progression.\nTaurine – Linked to lipid metabolism, blood pressure regulation, and oxidative stress.\nBetaine – Plays a role in homocysteine metabolism; imbalances can contribute to cardiovascular risk.\nTyrosine – Elevated in insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction.\nPhenylalanine – Increased in MetS, linked to impaired glucose metabolism.\nAcetylcarnitine – Implicated in fatty acid metabolism dysfunction in MetS.\nFructose – High intake contributes to insulin resistance and fatty liver disease.\nGlucose – A core biomarker of insulin resistance and diabetes.\nMannose – Altered metabolism is linked to insulin resistance.\nLactic Acid – Increased in mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic disorders.\nPyruvic Acid (Pyruvate) – Involved in glycolysis; alterations signal metabolic dysfunction.\n\n🟡 Moderately Associated Biomarkers (Need Further Validation):\n\nPutrescine & Cadaverine – Polyamines linked to gut microbiota and inflammation in MetS.\nSarcosine – Related to methylation and lipid metabolism, but its role in MetS is unclear.\nHistamine – Involved in inflammatory responses and metabolic homeostasis.\nHypotaurine – Precursor to taurine; may help counter oxidative stress in MetS.\nAsparagine – Altered levels may reflect amino acid metabolism changes in MetS.\nAspartic Acid – May be involved in energy metabolism and oxidative stress.\nMethionine – Essential for methylation reactions; altered levels may affect lipid metabolism.\nLysine – Essential amino acid; its metabolic disturbances could relate to insulin resistance.\nAnthranilic Acid – A metabolite of tryptophan linked to inflammation and gut microbiota.\nIndole-3-Lactic Acid – Gut-derived metabolite with possible metabolic and inflammatory implications.\n5-Hydroxy-L-Tryptophan (5OH-L-Tryptophan) – A serotonin precursor involved in neuroendocrine and metabolic regulation.\nXanthurenic Acid – A tryptophan metabolite associated with insulin resistance and oxidative stress.\nBenzoic Acid – Related to gut microbiota metabolism, possibly linked to MetS.\nXanthine & Hypoxanthine – Purine metabolism intermediates; increased levels may be linked to oxidative stress and insulin resistance.\n\n❌ Less Relevant or Weak Evidence for MetS:\nThese metabolites are less directly linked to metabolic syndrome but may still have indirect roles:\n\nMethylamine, Dimethylamine, Trimethylamine – Related to gut metabolism but not primary MetS markers. Monoisoamylamine – Limited data on its role in MetS.\nCytosine, Uracil, Thymine, Adenine, Guanine, Cytidine, Thymidine, Adenosine, Inosine, Uridine, Maltose, Ribose, Xylitol, Arabitol – These are nucleotides and sugars with limited direct associations to MetS.\nCaffeine – May have protective effects against MetS but is not a biomarker.\nCotinine – A nicotine metabolite, not directly related to MetS.\nMannitol, Lactose, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) – Not considered primary biomarkers for MetS.\n\n📌 Summary:\nStrongest biomarkers: TMAO, Choline, Serine, Glycine, Alanine, BCAAs (Isoleucine, Leucine), Taurine, Betaine, Acetylcarnitine, Glucose, Lactic Acid, Fructose.\nModerate biomarkers: Polyamines (Putrescine, Cadaverine), Tryptophan metabolites, Histamine, Hypotaurine.\nLess relevant metabolites: Nucleotides, sugar alcohols, caffeine.\n\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of TMAO\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Choline, Betaine, Carnitine (Acetylcarnitine), Trimethylamine, Dimethylamine, Methylamine\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Serine, Methionine, Glycine, Taurine, Creatinine, Histamine, Hypotaurine\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Fructose, Glucose, Lactic Acid, Pyruvic Acid, Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Cadaverine\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of Choline\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Betaine, Serine, Methionine, Glycine, Acetylcarnitine\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Trimethylamine, Dimethylamine, Methylamine, Taurine, Histamine, Creatinine\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Fructose, Glucose, Lactic Acid, Pyruvic Acid, Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Cadaverine\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of Serine\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Glycine, Methionine, Asparagine, Aspartic Acid, Glutamine, Pyruvic Acid\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Choline, Betaine, Taurine, Histamine, Lactic Acid\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Fructose, Glucose, Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Cadaverine, Creatinine\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of Glycine\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Serine, Methionine, Choline, Betaine, Glutamine, Aspartic Acid\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Taurine, Histamine, Acetylcarnitine, Creatinine, Lactic Acid\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Fructose, Glucose, Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Cadaverine, Phenylalanine\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of Alanine\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Pyruvic Acid, Aspartic Acid, Glutamine, Glutamate, Lactic Acid, Asparagine\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Serine, Glycine, Methionine, Creatinine, Glucose, Fructose\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Cadaverine, Phenylalanine, Taurine\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of Isoleucine\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Leucine, Valine, Aspartic Acid, Glutamine, Pyruvic Acid\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Alanine, Serine, Methionine, Creatinine, Lactic Acid, Glucose\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Histamine, Taurine, Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Fructose\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of Leucine\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Isoleucine, Valine, Aspartic Acid, Glutamine, Pyruvic Acid\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Alanine, Serine, Methionine, Creatinine, Lactic Acid, Glucose\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Histamine, Taurine, Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Fructose\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of Creatinine\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Creatine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Alanine, Glutamine, Glutamate\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Valine, Methionine, Aspartic Acid, Pyruvic Acid, Lactic Acid, Glucose, Fructose\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Histamine, Taurine, Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Mannose, Ribose\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of Taurine\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Methionine, Hypotaurine, Glutamine, Glutamate, Aspartic Acid\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Serine, Alanine, Creatinine, Glucose, Fructose, Lactic Acid, Pyruvic Acid\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Histamine, Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Mannose, Ribose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Correlation plot of metabolites considering all time points and nutrition models.

    "text": "Data collection occurred in monthly intervals:\nTime point 0: Baseline or pre-treatment\nTime point 1: 1 month after nutrition plan treatment\nTime point 2: 2 months after nutrition plan treatment\nTime point 3: 3 months after nutrition plan treatment\nTime point 4: 3 months after nutrition plan treatment (same as time point 3) but post-mortem measurements using a different blood sample extraction method than in the other time points.\nThe post-mortem clinical data i.e. weight, LDL, triglycerides etc. correspond to time point 4, and therefore match the metabolite data at time point 4. The match will be used to derive surrogate or substitute response variables (from the list of metabolites) for each variable of interest in the clinical data, since for the clinical data there is only 1 measurement in time. This is further described in the modeling page.\nTime point 4 will be excluded from the longitudinal analysis since it was post-mortem.\nAt time point 0 there were differences in the age of rats, and those differences are currently not known. At time point 1, these age differences were corrected by sampling the rat measurements asynchronously. Hence and since time will be a covariate in all models, age is not considered as a covariate i.e. proportional to time since all rats have same age from time point 1. In addition, in order to correct for age differences at time point 0, the models will adjust for metabolites at time point 0.",

    "text": "Metabolic syndrome is associated with several metabolites that reflect alterations in glucose, lipid, amino acid, and energy metabolism. Key metabolites include:\n\nLipid Metabolites\n\nTriglycerides (TG): Elevated in metabolic syndrome, indicating impaired fat metabolism. Free fatty acids (FFA): Increased levels contribute to insulin resistance and inflammation. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and Very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL): Higher levels of these “bad” cholesterol types are common. High-density lipoprotein (HDL): Reduced “good” cholesterol levels are a marker of metabolic syndrome. Ceramides: Bioactive lipids linked to insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease.\n\nGlucose and Energy Metabolites\n\nGlucose: Elevated fasting glucose is a diagnostic marker of metabolic syndrome. Insulin: High levels indicate insulin resistance. Lactate: Increased due to altered glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction. Ketone bodies (β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate): Altered levels indicate disrupted fatty acid oxidation.\n\nAmino Acid Metabolites\n\nBranched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) (Leucine, Isoleucine, Valine): Elevated levels are strongly linked to insulin resistance. Aromatic amino acids (Tyrosine, Phenylalanine): Increased levels are associated with obesity and diabetes risk. Glutamate and Glutamine: Higher glutamate and lower glutamine levels are associated with metabolic dysfunction.\n\nInflammatory and Oxidative Stress Metabolites\n\nC-reactive protein (CRP): A marker of systemic inflammation. Homocysteine: Elevated levels are linked to cardiovascular risk. Oxidized LDL: A marker of oxidative stress and atherosclerosis risk.\n\nGut Microbiome-Derived Metabolites\n\nShort-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) (Butyrate, Acetate, Propionate): Reduced levels may indicate an unhealthy gut microbiome. Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO): Elevated levels are associated with cardiovascular disease risk. These metabolites collectively indicate metabolic dysfunction, insulin resistance, and increased cardiovascular risk. Monitoring and targeting these biomarkers through diet, exercise, and medications can help manage metabolic syndrome.\n✅ Strongly Associated Biomarkers for Metabolic Syndrome:\n\nTrimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) – Elevated levels are linked to cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, and gut microbiota imbalance.\nCholine – Essential for lipid metabolism; imbalances are linked to NAFLD and insulin resistance.\nSerine – Low levels are associated with insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction.\nGlycine – Reduced in MetS; involved in antioxidant defense and glucose metabolism.\nAlanine – Increased in MetS; involved in gluconeogenesis and insulin resistance.\nIsoleucine – Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and metabolic dysfunction.\nLeucine – Elevated levels correlate with MetS, obesity, and T2D.\nCreatinine – A marker of muscle metabolism and kidney function, associated with insulin resistance and MetS progression.\nTaurine – Linked to lipid metabolism, blood pressure regulation, and oxidative stress.\nBetaine – Plays a role in homocysteine metabolism; imbalances can contribute to cardiovascular risk.\nTyrosine – Elevated in insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction.\nPhenylalanine – Increased in MetS, linked to impaired glucose metabolism.\nAcetylcarnitine – Implicated in fatty acid metabolism dysfunction in MetS.\nFructose – High intake contributes to insulin resistance and fatty liver disease.\nGlucose – A core biomarker of insulin resistance and diabetes.\nMannose – Altered metabolism is linked to insulin resistance.\nLactic Acid – Increased in mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic disorders.\nPyruvic Acid (Pyruvate) – Involved in glycolysis; alterations signal metabolic dysfunction.\n\n🟡 Moderately Associated Biomarkers (Need Further Validation):\n\nPutrescine & Cadaverine – Polyamines linked to gut microbiota and inflammation in MetS.\nSarcosine – Related to methylation and lipid metabolism, but its role in MetS is unclear.\nHistamine – Involved in inflammatory responses and metabolic homeostasis.\nHypotaurine – Precursor to taurine; may help counter oxidative stress in MetS.\nAsparagine – Altered levels may reflect amino acid metabolism changes in MetS.\nAspartic Acid – May be involved in energy metabolism and oxidative stress.\nMethionine – Essential for methylation reactions; altered levels may affect lipid metabolism.\nLysine – Essential amino acid; its metabolic disturbances could relate to insulin resistance.\nAnthranilic Acid – A metabolite of tryptophan linked to inflammation and gut microbiota.\nIndole-3-Lactic Acid – Gut-derived metabolite with possible metabolic and inflammatory implications.\n5-Hydroxy-L-Tryptophan (5OH-L-Tryptophan) – A serotonin precursor involved in neuroendocrine and metabolic regulation.\nXanthurenic Acid – A tryptophan metabolite associated with insulin resistance and oxidative stress.\nBenzoic Acid – Related to gut microbiota metabolism, possibly linked to MetS.\nXanthine & Hypoxanthine – Purine metabolism intermediates; increased levels may be linked to oxidative stress and insulin resistance.\n\n❌ Less Relevant or Weak Evidence for MetS:\nThese metabolites are less directly linked to metabolic syndrome but may still have indirect roles:\n\nMethylamine, Dimethylamine, Trimethylamine – Related to gut metabolism but not primary MetS markers. Monoisoamylamine – Limited data on its role in MetS.\nCytosine, Uracil, Thymine, Adenine, Guanine, Cytidine, Thymidine, Adenosine, Inosine, Uridine, Maltose, Ribose, Xylitol, Arabitol – These are nucleotides and sugars with limited direct associations to MetS.\nCaffeine – May have protective effects against MetS but is not a biomarker.\nCotinine – A nicotine metabolite, not directly related to MetS.\nMannitol, Lactose, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) – Not considered primary biomarkers for MetS.\n\n📌 Summary:\nStrongest biomarkers: TMAO, Choline, Serine, Glycine, Alanine, BCAAs (Isoleucine, Leucine), Taurine, Betaine, Acetylcarnitine, Glucose, Lactic Acid, Fructose.\nModerate biomarkers: Polyamines (Putrescine, Cadaverine), Tryptophan metabolites, Histamine, Hypotaurine.\nLess relevant metabolites: Nucleotides, sugar alcohols, caffeine.\n\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of TMAO\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Choline, Betaine, Carnitine (Acetylcarnitine), Trimethylamine, Dimethylamine, Methylamine\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Serine, Methionine, Glycine, Taurine, Creatinine, Histamine, Hypotaurine\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Fructose, Glucose, Lactic Acid, Pyruvic Acid, Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Cadaverine\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of Choline\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Betaine, Serine, Methionine, Glycine, Acetylcarnitine\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Trimethylamine, Dimethylamine, Methylamine, Taurine, Histamine, Creatinine\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Fructose, Glucose, Lactic Acid, Pyruvic Acid, Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Cadaverine\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of Serine\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Glycine, Methionine, Asparagine, Aspartic Acid, Glutamine, Pyruvic Acid\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Choline, Betaine, Taurine, Histamine, Lactic Acid\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Fructose, Glucose, Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Cadaverine, Creatinine\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of Glycine\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Serine, Methionine, Choline, Betaine, Glutamine, Aspartic Acid\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Taurine, Histamine, Acetylcarnitine, Creatinine, Lactic Acid\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Fructose, Glucose, Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Cadaverine, Phenylalanine\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of Alanine\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Pyruvic Acid, Aspartic Acid, Glutamine, Glutamate, Lactic Acid, Asparagine\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Serine, Glycine, Methionine, Creatinine, Glucose, Fructose\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Cadaverine, Phenylalanine, Taurine\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of Isoleucine\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Leucine, Valine, Aspartic Acid, Glutamine, Pyruvic Acid\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Alanine, Serine, Methionine, Creatinine, Lactic Acid, Glucose\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Histamine, Taurine, Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Fructose\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of Leucine\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Isoleucine, Valine, Aspartic Acid, Glutamine, Pyruvic Acid\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Alanine, Serine, Methionine, Creatinine, Lactic Acid, Glucose\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Histamine, Taurine, Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Fructose\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of Creatinine\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Creatine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Alanine, Glutamine, Glutamate\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Valine, Methionine, Aspartic Acid, Pyruvic Acid, Lactic Acid, Glucose, Fructose\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Histamine, Taurine, Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Mannose, Ribose\n\n\n\n📌 Summary: Best Predictors of Taurine\n🔥 Strongest Predictors: Methionine, Hypotaurine, Glutamine, Glutamate, Aspartic Acid\n🟡 Moderate Predictors: Serine, Alanine, Creatinine, Glucose, Fructose, Lactic Acid, Pyruvic Acid\n⚠️ Weaker Indirect Predictors: Histamine, Xanthurenic Acid, Putrescine, Mannose, Ribose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Correlation plot of metabolites considering all time points and nutrition models.

    "text": "Dimethylamine - Surrogate Of BUN\nThe BUN clinical measurement stands for Blood Urea Nitrogen.\nIt is a common blood test that measures the amount of urea nitrogen in blood.\nUrea nitrogen is a waste product that forms in the liver when the body breaks down proteins (amino acids). It travels in the bloodstream to the kidneys, which normally filter it out and remove it from the body in the urine.\nThe primary use of the BUN test is to evaluate kidney function.\n\nIf the kidneys are not working properly, they may not be able to filter urea nitrogen effectively, causing the BUN level in the blood to rise above the normal range.\nThe test is often ordered as part of a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP) or Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP).\nIt is frequently compared with the level of creatinine (another waste product) to calculate the BUN-to-Creatinine ratio, which is a more reliable indicator of kidney health and can help diagnose the cause of an abnormal result (e.g., dehydration, heart failure, or direct kidney damage).\n\nHigh BUN Levels\nA higher-than-normal BUN level (azotemia) can suggest:\n\nKidney injury or disease (the most common concern).\nDehydration (low blood flow to the kidneys).\nCongestive heart failure or recent heart attack (also causing low blood flow to the kidneys).\nUrinary tract obstruction.\nA high-protein diet.\nGastrointestinal bleeding.\n\nLow BUN Levels\nA lower-than-normal BUN level is less common but can be associated with:\n\nSevere liver disease (since the liver is where urea is formed).\nMalnutrition or a diet very low in protein.\nOverhydration (drinking too much fluid).\n\nNormal BUN levels generally range between \\(\\text{6}\\) and \\(\\text{24 mg/dL}\\) (milligrams per deciliter), but this can vary based on the lab and ones age and sex.\n\n\n[1] \"Lactose, Ascorbic_Acid, Putrescine, Trimethylamine_n_oxide, Ribose, Trimethylamine, Arabitol, Allantoin, Indole_3_Lactic_Acid, Creatinine\"\n\n\n\n\n\n     ### Summary of continuous variables ###\n\nNutrMod: Overall\n                n miss p.miss mean  sd median p25  p75 min  max  skew kurt\nDimethylamine0 34    0      0  815 549    984 109 1213   1 1720 -0.31 -1.2\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \nNutrMod: C\n               n miss p.miss mean  sd median p25  p75 min  max  skew kurt\nDimethylamine0 8    0      0  620 469    680 149 1030  40 1179 -0.15 -1.9\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \nNutrMod: HC\n                n miss p.miss mean  sd median  p25  p75 min  max skew kurt\nDimethylamine0 13    0      0 1133 546   1305 1030 1439   1 1720 -1.4  1.4\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \nNutrMod: HFHC\n                n miss p.miss mean  sd median p25 p75 min  max  skew kurt\nDimethylamine0 13    0      0  618 476    863  67 972  38 1224 -0.31 -1.9\n\np-values\n                  pNormal pNonNormal\nDimethylamine0 0.02413538 0.01351516\n\nStandardize mean differences\n                average   1 vs 2      1 vs 3   2 vs 3\nDimethylamine0 0.673444 1.008563 0.004941165 1.006828\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall\nC\nHC\nHFHC\np\ntest\nSMD\n\n\n\n\nn\n34\n8\n13\n13\n\n\n\n\n\nDimethylamine0 (median [IQR])\n983.81 [109.47, 1,212.88]\n680.38 [148.51, 1,030.49]\n1,304.85 [1,030.29, 1,439.43]\n862.54 [67.48, 972.41]\n0.014\nnonnorm\n0.673\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Dimethylamine at Month 0 : Baseline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Dimethylamine at Months 1-3 : Treatment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Proportion of nutritional model instances per metabolite concentration quantile (denoted by the average value of concentrations within each quantile).\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Nutritional Model Odds Ratio on Dimethylamine.

    "text": "Pyroglutamic - Surrogate Of Uric Αcid\nUric acid is a naturally occurring chemical compound in the body that serves as a vital marker for several metabolic and health conditions. It is the final waste product that results from the metabolic breakdown of purines.\n\nPurines are chemical substances that are components of DNA and RNA. They are found naturally in every cell in the human body, but they are also consumed through the diet, particularly in certain foods and drinks (like red meat, organ meats, seafood, and alcohol).\nThe body produces uric acid from these purines, mainly in the liver, and it typically dissolves in the blood.\nThe kidneys are responsible for filtering out most of the uric acid from the blood, which is then excreted from the body via urine.\n\nIn humans, uric acid also acts as a potent antioxidant in the blood, which can be a protective function.\nHigh Levels\nWhen the body either produces too much uric acid or the kidneys do not excrete enough of it, the level in the blood rises, a condition called hyperuricemia. This can lead to serious health issues:\n\nGout (Arthritis): This is the most well-known condition. When uric acid levels are too high, it can form sharp, needle-like monosodium urate crystals that deposit in the joints, triggering sudden, severe attacks of pain, swelling, and inflammation. The big toe is most commonly affected.\nKidney Stones: High concentrations of uric acid can crystallize in the kidneys, forming painful uric acid kidney stones.\nMetabolic & Cardiovascular Issues: Hyperuricemia is often associated with and may contribute to other conditions, including:\n\nHypertension (High blood pressure)\nChronic Kidney Disease (CKD)\nMetabolic Syndrome\nType 2 Diabetes\n\n\nNormal Range\nThe normal reference ranges for uric acid in the blood can vary slightly between laboratories and are generally different for men and women:\n\n\n\nGroup\nNormal Range (approx.)\n\n\n\n\nAdult Males\n\\(3.5 - 7.2 \\text{ mg/dL}\\)\n\n\nAdult Females\n\\(2.6 - 6.0 \\text{ mg/dL}\\)\n\n\n\nNote: The level that increases the risk of gout is often considered to be \\(\\text{&gt; 6.0 mg/dL}\\) or \\(\\text{&gt; 7.0 mg/dL}\\) as this is the point where the blood becomes saturated and crystals can begin to form.\nLow Uric Acid Levels\nWhile less common, lower-than-normal levels (hypouricemia) can also be a sign of underlying issues, such as:\n\nSevere liver disease.\nCertain rare inherited metabolic disorders.\nA side effect of some medications (e.g., those used to treat gout).\n\n\n\n[1] \"Uracil, Xanthine, Creatine, Serine, Isoleucine, Phenylalanine, Fructose, Glucose, Tyrosine, Adenosine, Methionine\"\n\n\n\n\n\n     ### Summary of continuous variables ###\n\nNutrMod: Overall\n               n miss p.miss mean   sd median p25  p75 min   max skew  kurt\nPyroglutamic0 34    0      0 4304 5937     25   1 9200   1 18183 0.94 -0.59\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \nNutrMod: C\n              n miss p.miss mean   sd median p25   p75 min   max skew kurt\nPyroglutamic0 8    0      0 5947 8277      1   1 14617   1 18183 0.71 -1.9\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \nNutrMod: HC\n               n miss p.miss mean   sd median p25  p75 min   max skew  kurt\nPyroglutamic0 13    0      0 3882 5408      1   1 8395   1 15480 0.98 -0.33\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \nNutrMod: HFHC\n               n miss p.miss mean   sd median p25  p75 min   max skew kurt\nPyroglutamic0 13    0      0 3716 5037    139   1 9235   1 11976 0.79 -1.4\n\np-values\n                pNormal pNonNormal\nPyroglutamic0 0.6816713  0.6613958\n\nStandardize mean differences\n                average    1 vs 2    1 vs 3     2 vs 3\nPyroglutamic0 0.2176336 0.2953509 0.3256828 0.03186713\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall\nC\nHC\nHFHC\np\ntest\nSMD\n\n\n\n\nn\n34\n8\n13\n13\n\n\n\n\n\nPyroglutamic0 (median [IQR])\n25.46 [1.00, 9,199.78]\n1.00 [1.00, 14,617.16]\n1.00 [1.00, 8,395.41]\n138.95 [1.00, 9,235.15]\n0.661\nnonnorm\n0.218\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Pyroglutamic at Month 0 : Baseline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Pyroglutamic at Months 1-3 : Treatment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 25: Proportion of nutritional model instances per metabolite concentration quantile (denoted by the average value of concentrations within each quantile).\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Nutritional Model Odds Ratio on Pyroglutamic.

With adjustment, graph (b), the differences of the nutritional models do not depend on the baseline value i.e. trend lines are almost parallel to each other.\n\n\n\nPyroglutamic acid (also known as 5-oxoproline or pidolic acid) is a metabolic intermediate in the \\(\\gamma\\)-glutamyl cycle, which is the primary pathway the body uses to produce and recycle glutathione, its most powerful internal antioxidant.\nClinically, measuring pyroglutamic acid is important because it acts as a “canary in the coal mine” for glutathione depletion and certain metabolic disorders.\nThe \\(\\gamma\\)-Glutamyl Cycle\nPyroglutamic acid is produced in the liver, kidneys, and brain. In a healthy cycle, it is a temporary “stop” on the way to making glutamate. An enzyme called 5-oxoprolinase normally converts pyroglutamic acid into glutamate so the cycle can continue.\nIf this cycle is interrupted—either because an enzyme is missing or because the body is under extreme stress—pyroglutamic acid “leaks” out into the blood (pyroglutatmic acidemia) and urine (pyroglutamic aciduria).\nA doctor might measure pyroglutamic acid (usually via a urine organic acid test) to investigate a High Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis (HAGMA)—a condition where the blood becomes too acidic for reasons that aren’t immediately obvious (like diabetes or kidney failure).\n\n1. Acquired Causes (Most Common)\n\nChronic Acetaminophen (Tylenol) Use: This is the most notorious cause. Acetaminophen depletes glutathione. When glutathione stores are low, the body’s feedback loop goes into overdrive to make more, accidentally causing an “overflow” of pyroglutamic acid.\nMalnutrition: A lack of the amino acids glycine or cysteine (the building blocks of glutathione) can cause the cycle to stall and pyroglutamic acid to build up.\nCertain Antibiotics: Drugs like flucloxacillin and vigabatrin can interfere with the enzymes in the cycle.\nSepsis or Liver Disease: Severe systemic illness can overwhelm the body’s antioxidant capacity.\n\n\n\n2. Genetic Causes (Rare)\n\nGlutathione Synthetase Deficiency: A rare inherited disorder that causes chronic high levels of pyroglutamic acid, leading to hemolytic anemia and neurological issues.\n5-Oxoprolinase Deficiency: A rare condition where the body cannot break down pyroglutamic acid, though this often has milder symptoms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n\nNormal\nTypically \\(&lt; \\text{170 mmol/mol creatinine}\\) (Urine). A small amount is normal.\n\n\nElevated\nSuggests glutathione deficiency, oxidative stress, or specific drug interference.\n\n\nVery High\nOften indicates Pyroglutamic Acidosis, requiring medical intervention to balance blood pH.\n\n\n\nSymptoms of High Levels\nBecause elevated pyroglutamic acid often coincides with metabolic acidosis, symptoms may include: * Rapid breathing (tachypnea) or shortness of breath. * Confusion or mental “fogginess.” * Extreme fatigue or malaise. * Nausea and vomiting.\nWhile pyroglutamic acid and uric acid are distinct molecules from two different metabolic pathways, they are “biochemical cousins” in the way they reflect the body’s antioxidant status and response to oxidative stress.\nThey are not directly made from one another, but they often “react” to the same health conditions.\n\n\n1. The Antioxidant Connection\nThe most significant link between them is their relationship to Glutathione, the body’s “master antioxidant.”\n\nPyroglutamic Acid: High levels of this usually mean the glutathione levels are depleted. When we run out of glutathione, our cells are left unprotected against damage.\nUric Acid: Interestingly, uric acid is also a powerful antioxidant (it provides about \\(50\\%\\) of the antioxidant capacity in the blood).\nThe Link: When glutathione levels drop (marked by high pyroglutamic acid), the body sometimes increases uric acid production as a “backup” to help neutralize oxidative stress.\n\n\n\n2. Common Triggers\nYou will often see both markers move out of range due to the same underlying causes:\n\nKidney Function: Both are cleared from the body by the kidneys. If kidney function is sluggish, both pyroglutamic acid and uric acid can build up in the blood.\nAlcohol Consumption: Chronic alcohol use depletes glutathione (raising pyroglutamic acid) and simultaneously increases the breakdown of purines (raising uric acid).\nMetabolic Syndrome: Conditions like obesity and insulin resistance are high-stress states for the body. This stress can lead to lower glutathione stores and higher circulating uric acid.\n\n\n\n3. Key Differences at a Glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nPyroglutamic Acid\nUric Acid\n\n\n\n\nOrigin\nThe \\(\\gamma\\)-glutamyl cycle (Glutathione)\nPurine metabolism (DNA/RNA breakdown)\n\n\nPrimary Meaning\nShows Glutathione deficiency or “waste”\nShows Purine turnover or excretion issues\n\n\nMain Clinical Risk\nMetabolic Acidosis (blood becomes acidic)\nGout and Kidney Stones\n\n\nMajor Trigger\nAcetaminophen (Tylenol), Malnutrition\nHigh-purine diet, Alcohol, Dehydration\n\n\n\nIn short: They are not the same thing, but if a lab report shows both are high, it is a strong signal that the body is under significant oxidative stress or that the kidneys are having trouble processing metabolic waste.",

Frank Harrell talks a little bit about this in Regression Modelling Strategies in the section about stepwise regression.\nStatistics is not an algorithmic truth generating process. You need to be able to say “I think X is related to the outcome” in order to make inferences of the nature statistics affords us.\n\nhttps://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/515412/circular-reasoning-in-harrell-bbr-18-19\n\nyou agree and understand why we should prefer c-index and likelihood ratio chi square (LHRCS) to classification accuracy\n\nhttps://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/621395/how-can-i-automatically-perform-multiple-linear-regressions-in-r-to-identify-the\n\nMy advice is to NOT automate this. There are a variety of methods to do automated model selection (forward, backward, stepwise). Of these, the only ones that I would use are penalized methods such as LASSO. What you seem to want is all subsets regression, which is possible in R. There are a few methods (you can Google “all subsets regression in R” to find some) but these aren’t good. P values will be too low, standard errors too small, models too complex and parameter estimates biased away from 0. (See Frank Harrell’s book Regression Modeling Strategies for details, examples, proofs and so on).\nWorse: It stops you from thinking.\nChoose models that make sense. Just a few of them. Compare those. You’ve already shown us that you’ve done some of this.\nIf you are interested in uncovering interactions, then trees (or some offshoot of them) may be good. I’m not sure why you are opposed.\nIf you want to look at combinations of variables, and don’t need to include the original variables, then partial least squares might be good. From the variables you’ve listed, it looks like the first component will be “size”, but that may be fine.\nHarrell: The worst thing I can think of saying about variable selection methods is that they fail at what they pretend to do. They can’t select the right variables. And small changes in the dataset result in different variables selected. They there is their destruction of standard errors …\n\nhttps://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/201061/whats-wrong-with-data-guided-modeling-in-regression\nhttps://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/200242/minimum-number-of-observations-needed-for-penalized-regression/200368#200368\n\nPenalized estimation can be used for very small sample sizes; it’s just that the estimates will be shrunk to the mean very heavily, so the estimates will be conservative. But the intercept in the model is not shrunk\n\nhttps://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/491861/penalized-or-standard-logistic-regression"
